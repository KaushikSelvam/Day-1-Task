                  Day 1 Task :

1) Difference between http 1.0 vs http 2.0 

Ans: 

http 1.0:
                           client
                               |
                               |
                 www.google.com
          ------------------------------------       
                                                         Request/Response              
                     Index.html ---------- connected with  TCP1--------- Server                                  
                     Index.css ----------- connected with TCP2  -------- Server                                          
                     JQuerry   ------------ connected with TCP3 ---------- Server                         
                     API-Calls 
        
	In  this when a client to open the google.com
	In that time html transfer to the TCP and then it will request to the server and server will response  acknowledge or not.
	 Again css transfer to the TCP and then it will request to the server and server will response  acknowledge or not
	 Again JQuerry transfer to the TCP and then it will request to the server and server will response  acknowledge or not   
	In there was a 3 TCP connections was happen 
	This method takes a lot of time because each and every line it request and we need to 
wait for a reponse . this was Major drawback in http 1.0.         

                                                                   
                          client
                               |
                               |
                 www.google.com
          ------------------------------------       
                                                         Request/Response              
                     Index.html ---------- 
                     Index.css ----------- Every thing connected in a single TCP connection -------- Server                                          
                     JQuerry   ------------  
                     API-Calls 


	When client request  to open a google.com
	In that time html, css , JQuerry will request to the TCP connection and from this it request to the server then it will response that I will acknowledge it or not
	It has been improved in the HTTP 2.0, it save the lots of time
	Html,css,JQuerry will be combined and given in a single TCP connect  then  request to the server and it will response faster.
	It won’t take too much time compared to HTTP1.0
2.Blog about objecte and its internal representation in javascript?

     i) Properties of object:
      1st method :  key = Value.
       Let Mobile = {
                Brand = "Oneplus",
                Model = 8,
                ROM &= “256 GB",
                RAM = "12GB",
                Processor = " Snapdragon",
                Year = 2020,
      }
     Console.log(mobile);

 2nd method:
 let Mobile = {
       Brand = "Oneplus",
       Model = 8,
       Year: 2000,
       Processor: "Snapdragon",
}
Console.log(mobile.year);
Output : 
2020

	By dot notation we can able to change the Value
             Mobile. model = 8T 
             console.log (Mobile. Model)
             Output: 
             8T
	Square Bracket Notation: 

Console.Log (Mobile ['Model'])

Output:

8

ii) methods:
	When we use the function inside the object then it is called as methods.
	When we use the function outside the methods then is called as function
Let Mobile = {

       Brand:="Oneplus",
                   Model = 8,
                   year = 2020,
                   Display = "OMLED",
Important : function () { 
             console.log(" Very Rare Mobile limited stock")
           }
}
Mobile.Important()

Output:
Brand = "onplus", Model = 8, Year: 2020, Display= "OMLED" ;
Very Rare mobile limited stock.

In this when you call only it will console, otherwise it don't log. It just a  defintion Important.

4. MAC Address Media Access Control (unique)?

	Each and every system MAC Address will be unique it won't repeat in another system.

	NIC (Network Interface  Card) - Every System have NIC Then only we can able to transfer the data, If NIC is not there means we can't able to connect to the network or pc.  
                                                
	When NIC device is manufactured, they given address that is called MAC Address.

	6 Byte Address. eg: 10:18:25:50:61 - Seperated by colon



	IP Address: Internet Protocol Address.
 
	It is also has unique address
	IP Address is generated by Internet Service provider
	There are two types, IPv4, IPv6.
	IPV4 - 32 bit IPV6 - 128 bit
	Dotted Decimal: 216.27.66.137.
	Binary: 10110111.10110111.111111. 101111 - 32 bit

	HTTP Method:
GET:

	It is also like POST, In this it will modify (or) update.
    DELETE:
	In this we can Delete the data.
